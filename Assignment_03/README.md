# Assignment 3 - Extendable Arrays  
This program will create a vector using an extendable array that works in a
circular manner without using the <vector> STL. It will test all the methods:
at(), insert(), set(), erase(), size(), and empty(). It will add eight
numbers (14, 5, 4, 1, 22, 33, 44, 88), delete 14, delete 1, insert 9 in the
front, insert 7 after 33, insert 44 at the end, and set the end to 88. It
will also find whether or not the vector is empty, how many integers are in
the vector, and find the front and the rear. It will output the vector after
every change with the index and the value, the size, the front and rear, and
whether or not it is empty.
