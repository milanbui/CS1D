# Assignment 6 - Double Hashing and Quadratic Hashing

 This program will create two map objects. One implements a map using double
 hashing and the other uses quadratic hashing. Both are stored in arrays. The
 program inserts entries with their keys and values (cities) and deletes
 entries by their key. The program also displays the map after changes.
