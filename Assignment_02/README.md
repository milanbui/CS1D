# Assignment 2 - Stacks, Queues, and Deques  
This program will create stacks, queues, and deques of names and of doubles. 
It will create stacks using both the STL <stack> and using a linked list.
It will create queues and deques using linked lists as well. It will then
display the stacks, queues, and deques before manipulating them. The name
Eric will be deleted from the stacks, queues, and deques(from the front) and
the number 8.445 will be removed as well (from the back in the deques). It
will then display the stacks, queues, and deques after doing so. Finally,
the program well check several mathematical statements to see if their
parentheses match.
